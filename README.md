# Rammy's Unity Shaders

A repository of Unity shaders I built to learn and explore

# Licensing

The shaders in this repository are released under the GPL-3 license.  
You can use them for ðŸ’° commercial work!  
If you modify them a lot, I'm curious to see what you make so please share!

ðŸ’— Thank you!
